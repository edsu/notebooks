These are just some random Jupyter notebooks.

You can try to lauch them on binder: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/edsu/notebooks)

Or to run them locally you'll need to install a few things:

    % pip install pipenv
    % git clone https://github.com/edsu/notebooks
    % cd notebooks
    % pipenv install

Then pick a notebook:

    % jupyter notebook ArchiveTeam.ipynb
