These are just some random Jupyter notebooks. You'll need install some things if you want to use them. First get [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and then:

    % pip install pipenv
    % git clone https://github.com/edsu/notebooks
    % cd notebooks
    % pipenv install

Then pick a notebook:

    % jupyter notebook ArchiveTeam.ipynb
