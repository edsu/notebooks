These are just some random Jupyter notebooks.  To run them locally you'll need
to install Python3 and a few things, preferably in a pipenv:

    % pip install pipenv
    % git clone https://github.com/edsu/notebooks
    % cd notebooks
    % pipenv install

Then pick a notebook:

    % jupyter notebook ArchiveTeam.ipynb
