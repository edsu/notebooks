    "According to [this article](https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/investigations/bs-md-state-park-social-media-accounts-merging-20190109-story.html) in the Baltimore Sun the Maryland Park Service has decided to consolidate all the individual state park social media accounts, including Twitter. This would effectively remove the historical record of feeds that people have followed. Let's use [twarc](https://github.com/docnow/twarc) to determine where these accounts are, and how many followers and tweets they have."
